&emsp;An **ANN** (Artificial Neural Network, **인공신경망**) is made of connected units or nodes called artificial neurons,which loosely model the neurons in a brain. These are connected by edges,which model the synapses in a brain. An articicial neuron receives signals from connected neurons, then processes them and sends a signal to other connected neurons.

&emsp;It wasn't promising field from the beginning. ANN is also a problem related to the gradient descent method used in learning, but they have emerged at a time when **the performance of hardware and parrallel operations is very low**. However, in modern times, the performance of hardware has improved and received a lot of attention.

## Main Subject

&emsp;**ANN** consists of a number of **nodes**. One node is **calculation unit**, which consists of many function, and it itself imitaties **Neuron**. And the unit that separates each node by use is called the '**layer**'. In addition, the numver of connections that can determine how many nodes and signals(data) each node sends and receives is called a '**net**'

## Structure

#### Simple neural network architecture

A basic neural network has interconnected artificial neurons in three layers:

#### Input Layer

Information from the outside world enters the artificial neural network from the input layer. Input nodes process the data, analyze or categorize it, and pass it on to the next layer.

> Input Layer is recieved input by dataset <br>
> The number of input variables and the number of input nodes are the same <br>
> When counting the number of layers of a neural network, the input layer is not included <br>

#### Hidden Layer

Hidden layers take their input from the input layer or other hidden layers. **Artificial neural networks can have a large numver of hidden layers.** Each hidden layer analyzes the output from previous layer, processes it further, and passes it on to the next layer.

> A neural network with more then on layer in which the calculation takes place is called **multilayer neural network** (alse multilayer perceptron, **MLP**) <br>
> The layer betweeen the input layer and the output layer <br>
> Since user can't see result of culculate in the hidden layer, we call this 'a hidden layer' <br>

#### Output Layer

The output layer gives the final result of all the data processing by the artificial neural network.It can have single or multiple nodes. For intance, if we have a binary (yes/no) classification problem, the output layer will have one output node, which will give the result as 1 or 0. However, if we have a multi-class classification problem, the output layer might consist of more than one output node.
