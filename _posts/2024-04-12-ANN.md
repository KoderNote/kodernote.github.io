&emsp;An **ANN** (Artificial Neural Network, **인공신경망**) is made of connected units or nodes called artificial neurons,which loosely model the neurons in a brain. These are connected by edges,which model the synapses in a brain. An articicial neuron receives signals from connected neurons, then processes them and sends a signal to other connected neurons.

&emsp;It wasn't promising field from the beginning. ANN is also a problem related to the gradient descent method used in learning, but they have emerged at a time when **the performance of hardware and parrallel operations is very low**. However, in modern times, the performance of hardware has improved and received a lot of attention.

## Main Subject

&emsp;**ANN** consists of a number of **nodes**. One node is **calculation unit**, which consists of many function, and it itself imitaties **Neuron**. And the unit that separates each node by use is called the '**layer**'. In addition, the numver of connections that can determine how many nodes and signals(data) each node sends and receives is called a '**net**'

## Structure

#### Simple neural network architecture

A basic neural network has interconnected artificial neurons in three layers:

#### Input Layer

Information from the outside world enters the artificial neural network from the input layer. Input nodes process the data, analyze or categorize it, and pass it on to the next layer.

> ⋅ Input Layer is recieved input by dataset <br>
> ⋅ The number of input variables and the number of input nodes are the same <br>
> ⋅ When counting the number of layers of a neural network, the input layer is not included <br>

#### Hidden Layer

Hidden layers take their input from the input layer or other hidden layers. **Artificial neural networks can have a large numver of hidden layers.** Each hidden layer analyzes the output from previous layer, processes it further, and passes it on to the next layer.

> ⋅ A neural network with more then on layer in which the calculation takes place is called **multilayer neural network** (alse multilayer perceptron, **MLP**) <br>
> ⋅ The layer betweeen the input layer and the output layer <br>
> ⋅ Since user can't see result of culculate in the hidden layer, we call this 'a hidden layer' <br>

#### Output Layer

The output layer gives the final result of all the data processing by the artificial neural network.It can have single or multiple nodes. For intance, if we have a binary (yes/no) classification problem, the output layer will have one output node, which will give the result as 1 or 0. However, if we have a multi-class classification problem, the output layer might consist of more than one output node.

> ⋅ In most of the output layer, **activation function** is exists, it uses differnt types depending on the problem to be solved <br>
> ⋅ In the case of a binary classification problem, using **a sigmoid function** to convert output into probability value to determine a class or label <br>
> ⋅ In the case of classifying maulti-class, the output layer exists as many as there are, and uses **softmax function** as the activation function

#### Deep neural network architecture

Deep neural networks, or deep learnig networks, have several hidden layers with millons of artificial neruons linked together. A number, called **weight**, represets the connections betwwen on node and another. The weight is a positive number if one node excites another, or negative if one node suppresses the other. Nodes with highter weight values have more influence oon the other nodes.

## The types of neural networks

#### Feedforward neural networks

Feedforward neural networks process data in one direction, from the input node to the ouput node. Every noded in one layer is connected to every node in the next layer. A feedforward network uses a feedback process to improve predictions over time.

#### Backpropagation algorithm

Artificial neural networks learn continuously by using corrective feedback loops to improve their predicitve analytics. In simple terms, you can think of the data flowing from the imput node to the ouput node through many different paths in the neural network. Only one path is the correct one that maps the imput node to the correct output node. To find this path, the neural network uses a feedback loop, which works as follows:

> 1. Each node makes a guess about the next node in the path
> 2. It checks if the guess was correct. Nodes assign higher weight values to paths that lead to more correct guesses and lower weight values to node paths that lead to incorrect guesses
> 3. For the next data point, the nodes make a new prediction using the higher wight paths and then repeat Step 1

It is not just use in one program. For instance, to do both image processing and netural languege processing(NLP) **CNN** and **RNN** can be used simutanously.

#### Perceptron

Perceptron is also a mathematical model of neuron described above, and is also the first proposed neural network program algorithm(1957).

#### Single-Layer Perceptron

A Structure with only an input layer and an output layer is called a single-layer percaptron. But in the beginning, in the acitivation function, which one of the funtions that make up a node, can't use non-linear function so it went down quickly.

#### Multi Layer Perceptron, MLP

It is called an ANN in earnest. As an improvement to Single-Layer Perceptron, It is MLP to use non-linear function in nodes, having a number of **additional layers** between the input layer and out layer. This additional layers is called **Hidden Layer**. Perceptron is consists of many Hidden Layers, usually has 1 to 4.
