&emsp;An **ANN**(Artificial Neural Network, **인공신경망**) is made of connected units or nodes called artificial neurons,which loosely model the neurons in a brain. These are connected by edges,which model the synapses in a brain. An articicial neuron receives signals from connected neurons, then processes them and sends a signal to other connected neurons.

&emsp;It wasn't promising field from the beginning. ANN is also a problem related to the gradient descent method used in learning, but they have emerged at a time when the performance of hardware and parrallel operations is very low.
