&emsp;An **ANN** (Artificial Neural Network, **인공신경망**) is made of connected units or nodes called artificial neurons,which loosely model the neurons in a brain. These are connected by edges,which model the synapses in a brain. An articicial neuron receives signals from connected neurons, then processes them and sends a signal to other connected neurons.

&emsp;It wasn't promising field from the beginning. ANN is also a problem related to the gradient descent method used in learning, but they have emerged at a time when **the performance of hardware and parrallel operations is very low**. However, in modern times, the performance of hardware has improved and received a lot of attention.

&emsp;**ANN** consists of a number of **nodes**. One node is **calculation unit**, which consists of many function, and it itself imitaties **Neuron**. And the unit that separates each node by use is called the '**layer**'. In addition, the numver of connections that can determine how many nodes and signals(data) each node sends and receives is called a '**net**'
